# Tech Docs Template - JS, CSS and other assets

This repo contains only the JavaScript, CSS/SASS and other assets from the [Tech Docs Gem][tdt-gem].

It's been built so that those assets can be used from frameworks other than Middleman, such as with the (experimental) [GOV.UK MkDocs theme][mkdocs-govuk].

> **Note**
> This repo is experimental, and not used by the Tech Docs Gem.
> We'll attempt to track changes over there in this repo, but no guarantees.

## Contributing

Everybody who uses this project is encouraged to contribute.

## GOV.UK frontend

This module uses [GOV.UK Frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend), part of the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

We use `npm` to download the `govuk-frontend package`. To update to a new version, change the version in the [package.json file](package.json) and run `npm update`.

### Use as part of your own website

You'll need to use these assets as part of a build pipeline in another project.

In time, this should be a properly-published NPM module, but for now you need to add it as a [Git Submodule][git-module].

For example (from another `alphagov` repository)

```
git submodule add ../tech-docs-assets
```

You'll need to set up:

* an SCSS build step (TODO example)
* a JavaScript bundling or transpilation step (TODO example)
* a build step that copies images and other assets into place (TODO example)

How you do this will depend on the web framework you're using.
